%input{ type: :text, readonly: true, size: 100, value: @url }

  This image will update periodically, so it should never be more than
  three hours behind your character's Armory information, but its URL
  will never change. Here's what your character's image looks like:

%p
  %img{ src: @url }

  You can copy and paste the following BBCode snippet to link your
  character's image to its Armory profile in a forum post or signature:

%p
  %textarea{ readonly: true, cols: 150, rows: 3 }= @bbcode
